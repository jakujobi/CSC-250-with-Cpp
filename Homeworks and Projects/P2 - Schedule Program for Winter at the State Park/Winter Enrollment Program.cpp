/* Program Requirements by Prof Paula Kurtenbach

Schedule Program for Winter at the State Park
A local state park is having a ‚ÄúWinter Fun‚Äù event.
Interested people can sign up to compete in the following activities:¬†
skiing, curling, ice skating, and sledding, on 5 consecutive Saturdays.

Write a program that the park can use to record enrollment in the event.
Use a¬† 2D array to hold the number of people participating in each activity, on each Saturday, where the activities are columns and the days are rows.

Provide a menu with the following options:
1. Enroll in an activity. (Ask the user for the activity and day)
2. Print the current enrollment. (Display entire array in a table with row and column headings, include the row totals, column totals, and overall total)
3. Exit

Your program must be modular, with separate functions for options 1 and 2 and also separate functions to find the row totals, column totals, and overall total.

/* User Flowchart

- Welcome message
- Main menu displays
- Inputs the choice
- 1 - Enroll in an activity
    - Sees the list of day
    - Inputs the Day of activities
    
    - Sees the list of actvities
    - Inputs the Activity type
    - Print the last Enrollment for that day
    - Inputs the new enrollment
- 2 - Print the current enrollment
    - Sees the enrollment show on the screen
- 3 -  Exit
    - The program ends
- Repeats the menu
