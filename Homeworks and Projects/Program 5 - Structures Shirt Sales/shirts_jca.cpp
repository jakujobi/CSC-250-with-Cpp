/* Description of program:
## **Shirt Sales Program**

The Shirt Sales program allows the user to order a shirt from a SDSU T-shirt vendor. The program stores the vendor's menu in a structure and displays it in a table format. The program allows the user to choose between ordering, checking out or exiting.

### **Program Features**

- Store vendor's menu in a structure that includes name, cost, and quantity for each size.
    
    
    | Field Name | Description |
    | --- | --- |
    | name | string |
    | cost | float/double |
    | qty | 5 element int array with qty for each size |
- Use an enumerated type for the size that contains the following enumerators: S, M, L, XL, XXL.
- Create an array of 5 structures and initialize the cost and name fields with the data from the shirts.txt file.

```
29.50 Go Jacks! Long Sleeve
35.99 Tangled SD Button Down
19.50 Engineer Jack T-shirt
44.50 Jacks Rain Jacket
31.99 Go Jacks! Fleece
```

- Set the qty fields to 0 when you read the file.

Using a loop, do the following:

- Display the menu in a numbered table with columns for the name, cost, and quantity for each size. Include an additional column for the total (cost*qty) for each item and print the order total at the bottom of the total column.
- Allow the user to choose between ordering, checking out, or exiting.
- Use separate functions to read the file, print the menu and print the bill.
- When the user chooses to checkout, print the bill with tax. Assume the tax rate is 6.5%.
Loop back to re-display the menu with the quantities reset to 0 to take the next order.

Use separate functions to read the file, print the menu and print the bill. Â Your output should be well-organized, neat, and easy to read.

### **Additional Features to Add**

- Add the ability for the user to select the shirt size and quantity they wish to order.
- Implement error checking to ensure that the user enters a valid choice.
- Add the ability for the user to view their order history and reorder previous orders.
- Implement a search function to allow the user to search for a specific item in the menu.
- Allow the user to add custom text to the shirt, such as a name or custom message.

### **Concepts to Use**

- Structured programming concepts, including structures, functions, and loops.
- Input and output operations in C.
- String classes
- Enumerated types.
- File I/O operations.
- Arithmetic operations and basic data types in C.
- Error handling and input validation.

/*Notes:
- Learned how to use structures and how to use them in a program
- Learned about member functions to avoid having to pass in the structure as a parameter
- Learned coding standards related to {} and indentation
    - I can put the opening brace on the same line as the function, instead of the next line
    - Makes the overall number of lines of code smaller
    - and easier to track matching braces
