/* Detailed program requirements
A text file named snowball.txt contains a 3-digit Team ID, number of times the team hit a member of another time (hits), and the number of times a member of this team was hit (times hit) for each team participating in a campus-wide snowball fight.  The data is organized on up to 50 lines in the data file, as shown below.

182 37 12

837 14 25

374 29 28

…

Write a program that allows the user to enter a team’s ID and displays the number of hits for that team.  You must use the binary search algorithm studied in Unit 1 in this program.  Your program should do the following:

1. Read the data from the file into partially filled, parallel arrays.
2. Sort the arrays, in parallel, putting the IDs in increasing order and keeping the number of hits and times hit in parallel with them. (When you swap two elements in the ID array, also swap the corresponding elements in the hits and times hit arrays.)
3. Enter a loop that does the following until the user chooses to quit:
    1. Read a team ID from the user
    2. Use the Binary Search algorithm to find the number of hits and times hit for that team.
    3. Print the number of hits, and times hit for the team requested. If the hits is greater than the times hit, print a Congratulations message.  If the ID entered is not in the data, print a “Not Found” message.

Your program must be modular, with separate functions to: read the data file, sort the arrays in parallel, input a number from the user, search, and print the results.  Your output should be well-organized, neat, and easy to read.

/* Draft FLowchart
- Print the welcome message to the screen
- Open the file
- Fill the file contents into the 3 arrays; ArrayTeamID, ArrayAttackHits and ArrayReceivedHits
- Prints the menu
    - Option 1: Check team Score
    - Option 2: Quit the Program
- Receive user menu input, verify the input and call the option
- Read the team ID, and check if it is in the right format
- Search the list of array and find the team or print an error message
- Print the team ID, Attack hits, Received Hits
- Print Congratulations message if the Attack hits are more than the Received hits
- Repeat the loop
- After the user chooses the quit option, close the file
- End the program
